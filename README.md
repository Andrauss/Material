# Material
A Material Design inspired library for use with JavaFX - Everything by code, not FXML files.

It was made on Netbeans. But you should be able to compile it on your preferred way or using with Eclipse.

It's designed to be only-code, and while it isn't very well documented right now, it's easy to generate new Material Designed objects without much hassle.
